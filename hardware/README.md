The hardware for the DMX shield is very simple.

An RS-232 driver chip such as MAX-485 or SN75176 and a resistor are the only necessary electrical components. Socketing components such as an XLR jack and headers connect the cape to the BeagleBone.

The cape is identical to other Arduino DMX shields, seen [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/DMX/DMXShield).
